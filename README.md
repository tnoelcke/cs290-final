# cs290-final
final project for cs90

Ok Guys here is where i am at,

I have the server built and serving static content but prepared to server more dynamic content once i get my data base pluged into my
server. I have created the data base and have seeded it with some data. 

Currently Alex and I have a modal up and running alon with the client side JS to display it and get the values from it.

I am however still trying to figure out how to send the server the correct data to login from the client side.
It's crude and probably bad but for right now I have global variables set up to manage the user being logged in on the client side (I will probably change that).

Also I have all the views built and working but will need some style ajustments.
